#Chatting Application in Java

This is a simple, real-time chat application built using Java. The project demonstrates the fundamentals of networking and multithreading in Java, allowing multiple users to communicate in a chat room environment. The app features a client-server architecture, where clients can join, send messages, and leave the chat room seamlessly.

##Features:
Client-Server Architecture: Centralized server managing multiple client connections.
Multi-threaded: Handles multiple users simultaneously.
Real-time messaging: Messages are broadcast to all connected users.
User-friendly Interface: Basic console-based or GUI (optional) interface for interaction.
Private Messaging: Allows users to send private messages to specific participants.
Server Logs: Tracks all user connections and disconnections.
Error Handling: Manages network and I/O errors gracefully.

##Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Java
Networking: Java Sockets (TCP)
Multithreading: Java Threads for handling multiple clients
UI: Console-based (or optionally implement Java Swing for a GUI)
